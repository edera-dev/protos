# Edera Protect

https://edera.dev/

https://github.com/edera-dev

Protect computing workloads with advanced isolation technology.

This repo contains Edera's public protobuf definitions.

These protobufs are published to a [`buf.build` repo here](https://buf.build/edera-dev/protect).

You can include these protos in your own `buf.yaml` like so:

``` yaml
deps:
  - buf.build/edera-dev/protect
```

The folder hierarchy, file naming and package naming schemes follow the [Buf style guide](https://buf.build/docs/best-practices/style-guide/).
